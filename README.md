# Tic-Tac-Toe-

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game created using Python. The project was developed during my studies using the PyCharm IDE.

Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Features :
Player vs Computer: Challenge the computer with a basic random move algorithm.
User-Friendly Interface: The game features a simple and intuitive console interface.

How to Run :

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in PyCharm or your preferred Python IDE.
Run the tictactoe.py file.
Currently it is the game between a human and computer
Enter the positions (1-9) to make your move.
The game will display the current board after each move.
The game will announce the winner or a draw when the game concludes.
